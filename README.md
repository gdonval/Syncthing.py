Syncthing.py
============

*This is a work in progress, not useful to anyone but myself at this time*

This repository is an implementation of the Syncthing protocol [1] using
asyncio, python 3's asynchronous server programming library. This repo
exists because:

1. I need a project to learn asyncio
2. Syncthing looks like a good candidate, as it needs an implementation
   other than the reference one

This will probably reach an usable status, but do this is not the primary 
objective. Right now, it is very far from that point.
